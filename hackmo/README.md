## Prompt

You will be creating a full-stack application to allow monetary transfer between users. In order to do this you will be using some pre-existing user data that you will store in a [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/) database. Your front end will display views created from data in the database. You will have the choice of using either [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) or [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and will serve your application with a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) web server, using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).

**BEFORE CONTINUING you must confirm you are running MySQL version 5.7** 
To check the version of the installed MySQL server: on Mac run `mysql_config --version` in the terminal; on Windows run `mysql -V` in the terminal and check the value printed for `Distrib`. **If you are running something other than 5.7.x, you must speak with your Technical Mentor before you can move on.**

NAME WHICH FRONT END FRAMEWORK YOU WILL BE USING FOR THE ASSESSMENT HERE:
* *[AngularJS or ReactJS]*:

HOW TO START THIS APP
* *[Modify this section to tell graders how to start your app]*

By design, this assessment contains more work than you will be able to complete in a day, so don't be concerned about not completing all of the features below. Rather, please work on the following features **in order**, moving on to the next feature only after the one you are working on is complete. **Please commit WORKING code early and often**, and in particular, commit after completing each feature.

### Getting Balance

![part one][one]

**Implement the following user story:**
 * As a user, when I enter my name and click "Get Balance," I expect to see my current balance.

Implement this user story by doing the following:
* Serve your application from the provided ExpressJS web server.
  * If using Angular:
    * Use the existing code in the `angular-client` directory, and build the app and balance directives using the dummy data in `dummy_data.js`.
    * Start your application with the command `npm start`.
  * If using React:
    * Use the existing code in the `react-client` directory, and build the app and balance components using dummy data in `dummy_data.js`. You may modify `react-client/src/components/index.jsx` if needed.
    * Start your application with two commands `npm run react-dev` and `npm start` in two separate terminal tabs. For more information about webpack, read the comments in `webpack.config.js` or take a look at [the Webpack Docs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/).
* Create the database and the users table using the provided schema.sql, following the directions provided in the comments to populate your database.
* Complete the getAllUsers function in `database/index.js`.
* In your express server `server/index.js`, add a route that will respond to GET requests to `/api/users` with an array of all users (including name, id, and balance).
* Replace your dummy data with the data obtained from the server.
* **WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step one complete".

### Transferring Money

![part two][two]

#### Implement the following user stories:
  * As a user, when I enter my name and click "Get Balance," I expect to see my current balance and a list of other users, excluding myself.
  * As a user, when I click on another user's name, I expect to see an input box and button to transfer money.
  * As a user, when I click on the button to transfer money, I expect my balance to reflect my updated balance after the transfer.
  * As a user, when I view my balance after another user transfers money to me, I expect my balance to be updated.


Implement this user story by doing the following:
  * Create any new components or directives as necessary.
  * Create any new server-side routes as necessary.

**WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step two complete".

### Transferring Money to Friends

![part three][three]

#### Implement the following user stories:
  * As a user, when I enter my name and click "Get Balance," I expect to see my current balance and a list of my friends.

Implement this user story by doing the following:
  * Use the data in `friends_data.js` to update your database to reflect friendships.
  * Update any components or directives as necessary.
  * Create any new server-side routes as necessary.

**WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step three complete".

### Transferring Money to Friends of Friends

![part four][four]

#### Implement the following user stories:
  * As a user, when I enter my name and click "Get Balance," I expect to see my current balance and a list of my friends and friends of friends.

Implement this user story by doing the following:
  * Use the existing data in your database and create any new query methods as necessary.
  * Update any components or directives as necessary.
  * Create any new server-side routes as necessary.

**WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step four complete".

### Limit transactions between users

![part five][five]

#### Implement the following developer stories:
  * When a user attempts to transfer more than $500 in one transaction, block the transaction and display a message.
  * When a user attempts to transfer to the same user more than two times within 15 seconds, block the transaction and display a message.

Implement this user story by doing the following:
  * Write rate-limiting middleware for your Express server (do no use any existing npm modules).
  * Create any new components or directives as necessary.

**WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step five complete".

### Authentication

#### Implement the following developer stories:
  * When a user enters their name and a password for the first time they check their balance, save this password to their account and require it for all subsequent logins.

Implement this user story by doing the following:
  * Write authentication middleware for your Express server.
  * Update any components or directives as necessary.

**WHEN COMPLETE** please make a commit with "step six complete".
